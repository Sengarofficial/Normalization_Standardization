# Normalization_Standardization:
Transformation of Features :
Why transformation of features are required ?

Linear Regression -- Gradient Descent -- Global Minima.
Algorithms Like KNN, K Means, Hierarichal Clustering -- Eucledian Distance.
Not Applicable to ensemble technique like Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGboost etc.

Deep Learning Techniques (Standardization, Scaling):
ANN --> Golbal Minima, Gradient Descent.
CNN.
RNN Each images has pixels value from 0 to 255 , that's why scaling and standardization requires.

Types of Transformation:

Normalization and Standardization.
Scaling to minimum and maximum values.
Gaussian Transformation:
            Logorithmic Transformation.
            Reciprocal Transformation.
            Square Root Transformation.
            Exponenetial Transformation.
            Box Cox Transformation.
